## cdocs

Cdocs is a code documentation library that generates a Markdown file from C structs, generated by macros. The documentation of Cdocs' functions were generated with Cdocs itself (see [./docs/docs.md](docs/docs.md) and [src/main.c](src/main.c)). 

### Documentation

The documentation for provided macros and functions is available at  [docs/doc.md](docs/docs.md), or can be generated by using the [doc.sh](doc.sh) script. 

### Installation

1. Copy the directory [./deps](deps) next to the "src" directory.
2. Run [./deps/cdocs_download.sh](deps/cdocs_download.sh). It will download necessary files.
3. Run [./deps/cdocs_install.sh](./deps/cdocs_install.sh). It will copy relevant files into the "src" folder of the project.
4. To uninstall, run [./deps/cdocs_uninstall.sh](./deps/cdocs_uninstall.sh). 

### Demo & example

A demo is available on the [example-calc](https://github.com/gael12334/cdocs/tree/example-calc) branch.
